# Angle Constraint Implementation - Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented angle limits for legs 2 and 3 in the platform controller. The angle constraint measures the angle between the platform center-to-leg vector and the leg vector itself, preventing extreme leg positions that could damage joints.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Platform Controller Updates (`platform_controllerMP.py`)

#### Constructor Enhancement
- Added `max_leg_platform_angle: float = 130.0` parameter
- Added comprehensive documentation explaining the angle constraint
- Default constraint set to 130° (recommended safe value)

#### New Methods Added
1. **`calculate_leg_platform_angle(platform_center, leg_attachment, leg_end)`**
   - Calculates angle between platform center-to-leg vector and actual leg vector
   - Uses dot product and arc cosine for precise angle calculation
   - Returns angle in degrees

2. **`check_angle_constraints(platform_center, leg_positions)`**
   - Validates angle constraints for legs 2 and 3 only (indices 1 and 2)
   - Provides detailed debug output showing:
     - Calculated angles for each checked leg
     - Whether constraints are satisfied
     - Clear pass/fail status
   - Returns True if all constraints satisfied, False otherwise

#### Integration in `calculate_slider_positions()`
- Added angle constraint checking after leg vector calculation
- Only checks legs 2 and 3 (as specified in requirements)
- Provides warnings when angle limits are exceeded
- Continues processing even when constraints are violated (warning-only mode)

### 2. Batch Processing Updates (`Batch_process_motions.py`)

#### Function Signature Updates
- Updated `process_file()` to accept `max_leg_platform_angle` parameter
- Modified argument tuple creation to include angle constraint

#### User Interface Enhancement
- Added comprehensive angle constraint configuration section
- Provides clear explanations and examples:
  - 130°: Default constraint (recommended)
  - 120°: More restrictive (safer for fragile joints)
  - 140°: More permissive (wider motion range)
  - 180°: No constraint (maximum freedom, use with caution)
- Includes warnings for extreme values

#### Controller Instantiation
- Updated PlatformController creation to pass angle constraint parameter
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality

## Usage

### Basic Usage with Default Constraint (130°)
```python
controller = PlatformController(
    leg_length=0.5,
    rail_max_travel=1.0,
    slider_min_travel_offset=0.25,
    log_file_path='debug.log',
    platform_side=0.44445926,
    max_leg_platform_angle=130.0  # Default constraint
)
```

### Custom Constraint Configuration
```python
# More restrictive (safer)
controller = PlatformController(..., max_leg_platform_angle=120.0)

# More permissive
controller = PlatformController(..., max_leg_platform_angle=140.0)

# No constraint (use with caution!)
controller = PlatformController(..., max_leg_platform_angle=180.0)
```

### Batch Processing Usage
When running `Batch_process_motions.py`, users will now see:
```
ANGLE CONSTRAINT CONFIGURATION
--------------------------------------------------
Enter maximum leg-platform angle in degrees (default 130.0): 120
✓ Angle constraint set to: 120.0°
```

## Debug Output
The implementation provides comprehensive debug output during processing:

```
=== ANGLE CONSTRAINT CHECK ===
Leg 2 angle: 125.3° (constraint: 130.0°) ✓
Leg 3 angle: 118.7° (constraint: 130.0°) ✓
All angle constraints satisfied: True
```

When constraints are violated:
```
=== ANGLE CONSTRAINT CHECK ===
Leg 2 angle: 135.2° (constraint: 130.0°) ✗
Leg 3 angle: 142.1° (constraint: 130.0°) ✗
All angle constraints satisfied: False
⚠ WARNING: Angle constraints violated for legs: 2, 3
```

## Technical Details

### Angle Calculation Method
The angle between vectors is calculated using:
```python
angle = np.arccos(np.clip(np.dot(v1_normalized, v2_normalized), -1.0, 1.0))
```

Where:
- `v1` = platform center to leg attachment point
- `v2` = platform center to actual leg end position
- Vectors are normalized before dot product calculation
- `np.clip()` prevents numerical errors in arccos

### Constraint Application
- Only legs 2 and 3 are checked (indices 1 and 2 in the leg array)
- Leg 1 is not constrained (as per requirements)
- Constraints are checked after leg position calculation in `calculate_slider_positions()`
- Violations trigger warnings but don't prevent processing

## Safety Considerations

### Recommended Constraints
- **130°**: Default safe value for most applications
- **120°**: More conservative for fragile or high-precision joints
- **140°**: Slightly more permissive for applications requiring wider range

### Warning Values
- **< 90°**: Very restrictive, may significantly limit motion
- **≥ 180°**: No effective constraint, use with caution

## Files Modified
1. **`platform_controllerMP.py`**: Core angle constraint implementation
2. **`Batch_process_motions.py`**: User interface and integration
3. **`test_angle_constraints.py`**: Comprehensive test suite (created)
4. **`simple_verification.py`**: Quick verification script (created)
